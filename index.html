      <h2> About Us</h2>
    
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>Founded with a deep love for animals and a strong sense of responsibility, our veterinary clinic was created to be more than just a place for treatments — it was designed to be a safe, welcoming space where pets are cared for with respect, empathy, and attention to every detail.</p>
        <p>From the very beginning, our mission has been clear: to combine modern veterinary medicine with genuine human care. We believe that every animal has a unique story, personality, and bond with their family, and that is why our approach is always personalized. We don’t treat numbers or cases — we care for lives.</p>
        <p>Our clinic is equipped with modern technology and carefully designed spaces to ensure comfort and safety for both pets and their owners. From routine check-ups to complex procedures, our team is prepared to offer reliable diagnoses, transparent communication, and treatments guided by ethics and compassion.</p>
        <p>Over the years, we have built strong relationships with our community, becoming a trusted partner in the health and well-being of countless animals. Every consultation, every recovery, and every wagging tail reinforces our commitment to quality care and respect for life.</p>
        <p>At our clinic, your pet is not just a patient — they are family.</p>
